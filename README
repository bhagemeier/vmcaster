Vmcaster is a simple tool for managing and updating your published 
virtual machines image lists. Following the Hepix image list format.

Users of this application should read "security-related policy requirements for 
the generation and endorsement of trusted virtual machine (VM) images for use on 
the Grid". The URL is shown below.

   https://edms.cern.ch/document/1080777

This tool is designed to aid "endorsers" as defined in the security policy, 
and anyone who wants to publish virtual machine images in a way where 
tampering will be detected.

vmcaster was designed with the realization that users typically create new 
virtual machines images rarely but update them frequently. Vmcaster attempts 
to be the first of a new generation of image list publishers the mimise the 
data entry for updating images, with imagelists.

The tasks of updating an image and uploading a fresh signed image is now just 
two quiet short command line operations away. The aim is to make image and 
imagelist updates as painless as possible as these are the most common 
tasks.

Internally the application uses a simple sql database, sqlight for storing 
image lists and multiple back ends managing uploading of images / images lists 
using a facade pattern. This allows transfer protocol to be derived from the 
meta data of the image list and a configuration file, updates need much less 
effort.


Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~

Please note this application has online help.

   $ vmcaster --help

This will always have an upto date list of command line options and state if they take parameters.

- Background

An image list contains an array of images and an array of endorsers. Imagelists 
Images and Endorsers can all have key value pair attributes. Some of these attributes are 
required in every imagelist. Similarly Endorsers and Images have a set of required metadata. Every 
Imagelists must have an endorser, but no images is allowed.

The easiest way to start playing with image list publishing is to copy some one else's hard work.

   $ wget https://cernvm.cern.ch/releases/image.list --no-check-certificate -o CernVM.list.smime

This is a large image list from the CernVm project. I provides a lot of images in a lot of formats 
so as many customers as possible benifit from the CernVM project. We should now import the 
image list.

   $ ./vmcaster  --import-imagelist-smime CernVM.list.smime

To check the image has been imported correctly we can use the command:

   $ ./vmcaster  --list-imagelist
   
To list the endorsers,

   $ ./vmcaster  --list-endorser

to list images:

   $ ./vmcaster  --list-image

To display the imagelist:

   $ vmcaster  \
       --select-imagelist e55c1afe-0a62-4d31-a8d7-fb8c825f92a2 \
       --show-imagelist 

Imagelist Object's "dc:identifier" is a special property of an imagelist, this 
is the object identifier and can be used to select items for creation, deletion 
or modification. Each Object has an Identifier, the Endorser object identifier 
is the value cossiponding with "hv:dn". Image Objects identifier is the same as 
an that of Imagelist "dc:identifier". 

It is recomended that UUID's are used for any imagelist "dc:identifier" and also
images "dc:identifier". Endorsers "hv:dn" shoud be the ceriticates subject.

To show image metadata:

   $ vmcaster  \
       --select-image b36d8b24-c63c-4fd1-ba13-bda6877207e8 \

To add an endorser to a image list:

   $ vmcaster  \
       --select-imagelist e55c1afe-0a62-4d31-a8d7-fb8c825f92a2  \
       --imagelist-add-endorser \
       --select-endorser "/C=DE/O=GermanGrid/OU=DESY/CN=Owen Synge"

To remove an image from the image list:

   $ vmcaster  \
       --select-imagelist e55c1afe-0a62-4d31-a8d7-fb8c825f92a2  \
       --imagelist-del-endorser \
       --select-endorser "/C=DE/O=GermanGrid/OU=DESY/CN=Owen Synge"

To change or add metadata to an :endorser

   $ vmcaster  \
       --select-endorser  "/C=DE/O=GermanGrid/OU=DESY/CN=Owen Synge" \
       --key-set-imagelist "hv:ca"    \
       --key-value-imagelist "/DC=ch/DC=cern/CN=CERN Trusted Certification Authority" 

To change or add metadata to an imagelist:

   $ vmcaster  \
       --select-imagelist e38a3fd2-0ed8-11e2-873a-001cc0beb420  \
       --key-set-imagelist "dc:description"        --key-value-imagelist "DESY Image List SHaring service" 

To change or add metadata to an image:

   $ vmcaster   \
       --select-image "2934ec2b-7a67-4b96-ba16-6775d66898d0"    \
       --key-set-image "hv:uri" \
       --key-value-image "https://cernvm.cern.ch/releases/17/cernvm-desktop-2.6.0-4-1-x86.vpc.gz" 


To delete metadate from :endorser

   $ vmcaster  \
       --select-endorser  "/C=DE/O=GermanGrid/OU=DESY/CN=Owen Synge" \
       --key-del-imagelist "hv:ca"    

To delete metadate from imagelist:

   $ vmcaster  \
       --select-imagelist e38a3fd2-0ed8-11e2-873a-001cc0beb420  \
       --key-del-imagelist "dc:description" 

To delete metadate from image:

   $ vmcaster   \
       --select-image "2934ec2b-7a67-4b96-ba16-6775d66898d0"    \
       --key-del-image "hv:uri" 


Obnect itentifiers cannot be modified with vmcaster, they can only be created 
and destroyed,. This is intentioanl to prevent accidental errors.

Imagelists with clashing  "dc:identifier" value is conisdered disruptive at 
best and hostile at worst, and it will be noticed by imagelist subscibers. 
Similarly not having your endorser details correctly is stated in the endorser.

To chnage "dc:identifier" this we need to dump the imagelist to file, change 
the imagelist UUID, all images we wish to keep 

    
   $ vmcaster  \
       --select-imagelist e55c1afe-0a62-4d31-a8d7-fb8c825f92a2 \
       --show-imagelist > output.json
   $ OLD_LIST_UUID=e55c1afe-0a62-4d31-a8d7-fb8c825f92a2
   $ NEW_LIST_UUID=aaac1afe-0a62-4d31-a8d7-fb8c825f92a2
   $ sed -e "s/${OLD_LIST_UUID}/${NEW_LIST_UUID}/"  output.json  > input.json
   $ vmcaster --import-imagelist-json input.json

It might be easiest to edit the json with a conventional text editor. As you 
also want to change many other variables.

It is recomended that only experienced used with good reason share images 
between  imagelists (primarily diskspace and automation), for this reason while 
editing the  json. So it is probably wise to change all Image object 
identifiers.

      
All changes to the original imagelist can be reverted by re - importing the imagelist.

To Add an image to a image list:

   $ vmcaster  \
       --select-imagelist e55c1afe-0a62-4d31-a8d7-fb8c825f92a2  \
       --imagelist-add-image \
       --select-image 3a1df02c-121a-461d-b720-521903ef99f0
       
The final setting up task is now to set up the configuration file.

Configuration file.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration file for vmcaster is used to define the hosts and parameters 
needed to update images and imagelists on the servers publishing the image list.

The configuration file is expected system wide at "/etc/vmcaster/vmcaster.cfg" or per 
user at "~/.vmcaster.cfg". The image list is in ini/cfg format with all values being 
stored as json. Each section will map to one or more image lists and provides the 
necessary information to "vmcaster" to update and upload image lists.

The following section is taken from my image list management configuration.

   [dish.desy.de]
   server = "dish.desy.de"
   writeprotocol = "gsidcap"
   uriMatch = "https://dish.desy.de:2880/"
   uriReplace = "gsidcap://dcache-desy-gsidcap.desy.de:22128/pnfs/desy.de/desy/vmimages/"

This states that all image lists to be published on the server "dish.desy.de",
should be updated using the "gsidcap" protocol, and that all writes corresponding 
with a prefix of "https://dish.desy.de:2880/" should be updated using a prefix of
"gsidcap://dcache-desy-gsidcap.desy.de:22128/pnfs/desy.de/desy/vmimages/". The 
secion name is not significant and is just to group the attributes.

The following write protocols are currently supported: "scp" this is the standard 
file transfer tool from the openssh project. 

"gsidcap" for a long time this was the standard posix like write protocol for a file 
storage server called dCache which specializes in storing very large quantities of 
data at the lowest price possible. The following example is working but publishes 
files locally.

   [foo]
   server = "gridvirt.desy.de"
   writeprotocol = "local"
   uriMatch = "https://gridvirt.desy.de/"
   uriReplace = "/tmp/"

Note: Publishing an Imagelist without any images is the best way to decomison an
imagelist when no images are expected to be requested ever again.

To update an Image:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we can select an image to and update it.

   $ vmcaster \
      --upload-image /var/lib/libvirt/images/hudson-slave-vm06.desy.de.img \
      --select-image 7b1aea46-8776-4447-9450-00e720fc042c
   
Shows the image list as it would be made.

   $ vmcaster \
      --select-imagelist 9b6fad19-d913-4cca-b77d-c4b4fcd9dc36  \
      --imagelist-show
      
whis shodul now have the "hv:uri" set to the correct path to download the image
that was just updated, including the "sl:sha512" firled and incremented the 
version number. Once you are happy with the new image list, it is time to publish this.

# To update and sign image list.

   $ vmcaster \
      --select-imagelist 9b6fad19-d913-4cca-b77d-c4b4fcd9dc36 \
      --upload-imagelist

# to list stored imagelists.

   $ vmcaster  --imagelist-list

        --imagelist-add-endorser  \
        --select-endorser "/C=DE/O=GermanGrid/OU=DESY/CN=Owen Synge"

Unbinding endorser to an imagelist

   $ ./vmcaster    --select-imagelist e38a3fd2-0ed8-11e2-873a-001cc0beb420    \

   $ vmcaster  --del-imagelist --select-imagelist 9b6fad19-d913-4cca-b77d-c4b4fcd9dc36


Upload images:

   $ vmcaster \
      --upload-image sl6.cpio.bz2 \
      --select-image aa42ca85-179b-4873-b12e-32d549bf02b6 \
      --verbose --verbose --verbose 

Upload image lists:

      --verbose --verbose --verbose 



Configuration file.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration file for vmcaster is used to define the hosts and parameters 
needed to update images and imagelists on the servers publishing the image list.

The configuration file is expected system wide at "/etc/vmcaster/vmcaster.cfg" or per 
user at "~/.vmcaster.cfg". The image list is in ini/cfg format with all values being 
stored as json. Each section will map to one or more image lists and provides the 
necessary information to "vmcaster" to update and upload image lists.

The following section is taken from my image list management configuration.

   [dish.desy.de]
   server = "dish.desy.de"
   writeprotocol = "gsidcap"
   uriMatch = "https://dish.desy.de:2880/"
   uriReplace = "gsidcap://dcache-desy-gsidcap.desy.de:22128/pnfs/desy.de/desy/vmimages/"

This states that all image lists to be published on the server "dish.desy.de",
should be updated using the "gsidcap" protocol, and that all writes corresponding 
with a prefix of "https://dish.desy.de:2880/" should be updated using a prefix of
"gsidcap://dcache-desy-gsidcap.desy.de:22128/pnfs/desy.de/desy/vmimages/".

The following write protocols are currently supported: "scp" this is the standard 
file transfer tool from the openssh project. "gsidcap" for a long time this was the 
standard posix like write protocol for a file storage server called dCache which

   [foo]
   server = "gridvirt.desy.de"
   writeprotocol = "scp"
   uriMatch = "https://gridvirt.desy.de/"
   uriReplace = "root@vmic-virt-grid:/tmp/"

This is another example of a configuration section that is updated using the scp protocol,
rather than the "gsidcap" protocol previously described.

Environment Variables.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* HOME *

Used as a prefix for configuration files and certificates.

* DISH_KEY *

Path to the private key for the signing of image lists.

* DISH_CERT *

Path to the certificate for the signing of image lists.

* DISH_CFG *

Path to the configuration file for vmcaster.

* DISH_RDBMS *

Sqllight based connection string, Typically defaulting to 'sqlite:///dish.db'.
This URL refers to the current working directory, to use an absolute path with 
Sqlight, add an extra slash to the URL like syntax.

Road map
~~~~~~~

The code should also be publishable into a message Queue service provided by a 
cloud provider allowing unpublished images to be shared. This work has not been 
started.

Appendix
~~~~~~~

If this application is not suitable for your use case it should not be forgotten that 
SMIME and json are common standards and can be created in many ways. Below is an 
example of how to sign a message using SMIME.

   $ openssl smime her-cert.pem -encrypt -in my-message.txt
   
This may prove useful in the long term.
